    <h1>I'm so Hangry</h1>
    <h2><strong>Han·gry<br></strong></h2>
    <h4><em>/'haNGgrē/</em></h4>
    <p><em>bad-tempered or irritable as a result of hunger.<br> 
        <strong>"You should really eat. You're gonna get hangry again."</strong></em></p>
    <p>Working from home has given me the time to get lost in thought. Being able to allocate that energy is a skill.
        I dedicated my working life in the restaurant industry for 8 years. About a year ago, I decided to change careers since life
        aligned with the world's circumstances and ambitions of my own. I now work from home and find myself in a prediciment. 
        Not having enough time, and having too much time on my hands. Operating in a tech-company has motivated me to be a student again.
        Learn a new skill, incorporate old passions and tie it together with your own goals.</p>
    <p>My dream is to be a stay at home dad. I want my kids to eat healthy and to live long. I want them to taste the cooking 
        of <em>their</em> future grandparents one day and what made me feel at home. I know there's still a long way to go,
        but I might as well sharpen my skills now.</p>
    <p><em>For my future family,<br><br>
    May we come home to a good life, good company and good food.</em></p>
