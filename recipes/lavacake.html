    <h1>Molten Lava Cake for Kat</h1>

    <h4>Inspired by Kat for Valentines Day 2020</h4>
    <p>The very first dessert my partner made for me was a microwaved chocolate mug cake. In the years prior to this one, 
        I've yet to make something or even celebrate Valentines Day with my partner since I worked in the restaurant industry. 
        This year, my restaurant closed down and I ended up having time. Although we don't typically celebrate this day, 
        I still haven't had the chance to say thank you for one of the finest desserts I've ever had. She spent
        Christmas in the Phillipines and brought home <em>Davao Fine Tablea</em>, which was something nostalgic to them in form
        of a thick hot chocolate. Here's the first dessert I've ever made for them:</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Davao Fine Tablea</li>
        <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>2 Eggs + 2 Yolks</li>
        <li>1/4th Cup Sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>All Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>Ice Cream, I used tuxedo from <em>Rocky Point</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>I actually did not write down the steps</li>
        <li>Made a frozen ganache with the chocolate</li>
        <li>Made it like in the movie <em>Chef</em></li>
        <li>This was two years ago but I'll try again this year, 2022</li>
        <li>Will be able to update this soon :)</li>
        <li>She said it was the best dessert she's ever had, and that's all I need to know.</li>
        <li>And we lived happily ever after.</li>
    </ol>
