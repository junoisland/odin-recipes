    <h4>A Filipino beef soup inspired by my potassium deficiency. A healthy, tasty 'ordinary day' soup.</h4>
    <p>This dish is a staple in any Filipino household. A combination of tender meat, potatoes, beans, cabbage, sweet corn and Banana
        tied together with beef broth and <em>patis</em> (fish sauce). My parents used to tell me that this would keep me away
        from the doctors' and help me grow tall. I'm not sure if that's true, but I would eat this even if it didn't.</p>
    <h4><strong>Ingredients/Prep</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef or Pork, beef shank or pork ribs are best</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li><em>Paminta</em> (whole peppercorn)</li>
        <li>2 Large Potatoes, yellow is nice, cubed</li>
        <li>Sweet Corn, as much as you'd like, cut in half</li>
        <li><em>Patis</em> (fish sauce), less sodium the better</li>
        <li>Napa Cabbage, cut in chunks</li>
        <li>Spring Onions</li>
        <li>Saba Banana</li>
        <li>Medium Onion, sweet</li>
        <li>Beef Cube or Powder</li>
        <li>Salt + Pepper</li>
        <li>Rice, rooster</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>Steps:</strong></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Season meat the night before, this will make your meat super tender and absorb all the broth. If you really
            want to elevate your homecooking in general, salt your meat.</li>
        <li>Pout hot water over meat and onion chunks on medium-high until tender. Usually about 1-2 hours. Go by taste.
            Scoop any foam/froth that you see every 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add beef cube/stock and patis to taste. An alternative is to use salt, but use your tastebuds as judgement.</li>
        <li>Add corn, banana and potatoes for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Right before serving, add the napa cabbage as it's super fast to cook.</li>
        <li>As a side dip, mix patis with chili flakes</li>
        <li>You're done. Seriously that's it. It's hard to fail making this dish. Serve with rice and let your loved ones compliment you.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Things to note: Buy fish sauce with the lowest amount of sodium. Filipino's don't have the longest life expectancy and that may
        be due to such a salty diet. Make sure there is enough broth, add water, patis, and beef stock accordingly. Hope you enjoy :)</p>
