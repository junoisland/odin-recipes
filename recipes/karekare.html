    <h1>Kare Kare (Oxtail Stew)</h1>
    <img src="./images/karekare.jpeg">
    <h4>A Filiipno stew inspired by my roots in <em>Pangasinan</em></h4>
    <p>When I was younger, this would be the only dish my father knew how to cook.
        It's made with the <em>creaminess</em> of <strong>peanut butter</strong> and complimented with the <em>saltiness</em> of <strong>bagoong</strong> (shrimp paste)
        to create one of the greatest of all-time flavours. 
        I decided to recreate this memory and preserve the recipe for my future kids to enjoy a treasured memory of their grandfather.</em></p>
    <h4><strong>Ingredients/Prep</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 1/2 lbs. Ox Tail, seasoned the night before</li>
        <li>1 1/2 lbs String Beans, cut in 1/4ths soak in salted water</li>
        <li>1 Long Eggplant, cut in even halves and seasoned</li>
        <li>Peanut Butter, preferabbly creamy</li>
        <li>Unseasoned Peanuts, ground</li>
        <li>Bagoong (shrimp paste), preferably spicy</li>
        <li>Annatto Seed/Powder</li>
        <li>Unlimited Garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 Sweet Onion, diced</li>
        <li>Yu Choy, or baby bok choy, spinach(if you're desperate)</li>
        <li>Banana flower(if you can find it)</li>
        <li>Salt + Pepper</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Peanut oil</li>
        <li>All Purpose Flower/Cornstarch, for thickening</li>
        <li>Rice, rooster</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>Steps:</strong></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Make rice.</li>
        <li>Saute√© onions and garlic together with some peanut oil on medium until lightly carmalized and sear oxtail gently on all sides.</li>
        <li>Pour as much water to cover the oxtail. The more water you put, the more stew <em>(sabaw)</em> you'll have.</li>
        <li>Let this simmer for about 2-2 1/2 hours until tender. Scoop up any of the foam that rises periodically.
            Add beef(or pork) stock/powder for flavour. Try to avoid adding additional salt for less sodium intake.</li>
        <li>Here we can start grilling/searing your eggplant on a separate pan and prep all your veggies.</li>
        <li>Stir in peanut butter and ground peanuts until you have a creamy consistency and nutty flavour.</li>
        <li>Add annatto seed/powder by mixing it in cold water until no lumps. Add it in the stew until the right colour.
            Here is where you can adjust your stew's flavour. Add more peanut butter or annatto for a nuttier flavour,
            beef/pork stock for saltiness, and water for more sabaw. Don't worry about the stew being salty,
            let the bagoong work it's magic.
        <li>Add veggies into the stew.</li>
        <li>Mix cornstarch/all-purpose flower with about 30ml of water. Add it into the stew, and stir delicately.
            You'll notice the stew start to thicken quickly, repeat this process until it's as gloopy as you would like.</li>
        <li>Serve with rice and bagoong on a side plate.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I hope you enjoy :)</p>
